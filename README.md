# Sales-ETL-Project

This project consist in a general ETL process to a dataset using different python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Request. 

## Extraction: 
In the extraction module I used the request library to consume an external API, to verify the connection and to extract the data. I also used pandas to extract the data from a csv file and to convert the data into dataframes.

## Transform:
Once the data is extracted and converted, I used pandas and numpy for data cleaning puporses. 

## Load:
Finally the extracted and cleaned data is dynamically uploaded as a csv file to a data warehouse.
